Problem:
Development and validation of advanced driver assistance (ADAS) features like Forward Collision Warning (FCW) is complex and time consuming. Industry is witnessing cutting edge solutions like Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) being used for accelerating software development lifecycle, optimizing the efforts and assuring an early start of production. 
There are automotive software development guidelines and safety critical aspects involved in the process of applying GenAI techniques in core automotive domains software development, validation and embedded porting.

Challenges:
Develop innovative GenAI based solutions to accelerate software development for ADAS feature, specifically FCW function source code development & showcase the working demo:
 • Code generation: Use a GenAI tool to generate source code and test cases for FCW.
 • Compliance: Code must be compliant to automotive regulations such as MISRA/ ASPICE/ functional safety.
 • Validation: Test the functionality of source code generated using test cases and demonstrate the working system.
 • Strategy: Object detection part of FCW can be implemented using AI ML or conventional techniques. Generating source code for AI ML techniques using GenAI might be complex. Training the ML model is normally done manually in a supervised manner.
 • Accuracy: Generated source codes should be accurate in object detection as well as enabling FCW function.
 • Requirements: A set of system requirements for the FCW feature shall be the input of the GenAI based framework. The generated source codes should satisfy the input requirements. Generated test cases should have su cient test coverage against the requirements. The test cases when executed on the source code, should provide pass test results.
